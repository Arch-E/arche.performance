/**
 * A (default) Hibernate-based implementation of ArchEArchitecture, as the architecture for 
 * external reasoning frameworks to work with. An architecture is seen by 
 * ArchE as a design alternative for a set of scenarios.
 * <p>
 * The architecture includes two components: a responsibility structure 
 * (for responsibilities and their relations) and a design view (for design elements 
 * and design relations). Default implementations for these two components are
 * ArchECoreResponsibilityStructure and ArchECoreView respectively.  
 * <p>
 * The architecture is a top-level container that is responsible for restoring, 
 * saving or updating its contents to the database.
