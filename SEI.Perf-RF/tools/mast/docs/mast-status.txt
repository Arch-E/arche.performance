                       ----------------

Version 1.2.2
-------------

   This version fixes a bug in the offset-based analysis technique.
   Thanks to Ola Redell for catching it.

Version 1.2
-----------

   This version introduces support for analysis of linear systems with
   offsets, delays, or rate divisors. The tools supporting these
   features are the linear analysis tools (offset-based, and holistic)

   This version adds the following tools:

       Classic_RM_Analysis
       Varying_Priorities_Analysis

   This tool introduces a new format for the results, and a gui tool
   to view those results (gmastresults)

   Other changes introduced:

       Added the Permanent_Overridden_Scheduling_Parameters object,
       to represent the case in which an operation changes its
       priority to a given value, but does not return to the previous
       value at the end of the operation. This new part of the model
       is analyzable with the Varying_Priorities_Analysis tool.

       Added the processing resource slacks and the operation slacks.

Version 1.1
-----------

   This version adds the following tools:

       Monoprocessor_Priority_Assignment
       Linear_HOPA
       Linear_Simulated_Annealing      

   Changes introduced:

       Added the "preassigned" field to scheduling parameters and
       immediate_ceiling shared resources, to allow the designer to
       specify which priorities are to be assigned or preserved.
